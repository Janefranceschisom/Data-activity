 #Data manipulation
 For this activity ,i applied the filter function across the headers for each column in the table then filtered the data from the job type column to show just employees working as freelancers.
 After getting this , i highlighted and applied the *conditional formatting* function to the salary column with the rule to highlight cell with the highest salary in green while the lowest salary was in red.
